want to have the ability to quick access apps by their name's first character

```
- Firefox
- Finder
- SomaFm
```

The user might be able to pick the "F" key, but there are 2 apps that start
with that character.
It needs an order/priority/weight!

First build a list of the used apps and track their usage.
Initially, 2 (or more) apps starting with the same name, will have the same
weight, so it won't be distinguish between them(and won't be able to assign
a quick action neither).
In time while the app is being used, an app will definately be used more often
then another, at which point it might be able to weight an app over the other
eg: in time Firefox will outweight Finder, so it is gonna receive a quick action
of the letter "F"
